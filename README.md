# ChatBot_Retrieval_Based

A chatbot is frequently described as one of the most advanced and promising forms of human-machine interaction.

Chatbots can automatically simulate interactions with customers based on a set of predefined conditions or events.

From a technology standpoint, however, a chatbot is simply the
next step in the evolution of a Question Answering system that
uses Natural Language Processing (NLP). One of the most
common examples of Natural Language Processing is usage in
many organizations' end-use applications in formulating
responses to inquiries in natural language.

#Retrieval_Based

Retrieval based chatbots, employ techniques such as keyword
matching, machine learning, and deep learning to find the most
appropriate response. These chatbots, regardless of
technology, solely deliver predefined responses and do not
generate fresh output. From a database of predefined
responses, the chatbot is trained to offer the best possible
response. The responses are based on previously collected data.
