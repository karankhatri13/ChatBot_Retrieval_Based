# ChatBot_Retrieval_Based

A chatbot is frequently described as one of the most advanced and promising forms of human-machine interaction.

Chatbots can automatically simulate interactions with customers based on a set of predefined conditions or events.

From a technology standpoint, however, a chatbot is simply the
next step in the evolution of a Question Answering system that
uses Natural Language Processing (NLP). One of the most
common examples of Natural Language Processing is usage in
many organizations' end-use applications in formulating
responses to inquiries in natural language.

#Retrieval_Based

Retrieval based chatbots, employ techniques such as keyword
matching, machine learning, and deep learning to find the most
appropriate response. These chatbots, regardless of
technology, solely deliver predefined responses and do not
generate fresh output. From a database of predefined
responses, the chatbot is trained to offer the best possible
response. The responses are based on previously collected data.

#Intent_Classification

Intent recognition is a form of natural language processing
(NLP), a subfield of artificial intelligence. Natural language
processing (NLP) and analysis is concerned with computers
processing and analyzing natural language, that is, any
language that has evolved naturally rather than artificially, such
as computer coding languages.

Intent classification or intent recognition is the task of taking a
written or spoken input, and classifying it based on what the
user wants to achieve. Intent recognition forms an essential
component of chatbots and finds use in sales conversions,
customer support, and many other areas.
